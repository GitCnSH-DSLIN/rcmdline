TCommandLineReader
==================
 
This unit provides an advanced, platform-independent command line parser for Lazarus and Delphi.

It checks for allowed options, automatically prints a help with a list of all of them, and -- contrary to the parser in the rtl -- behaves the same on Windows and Linux.
